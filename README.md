** In this analysis, we observed that the genetic algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to other algorithms when applied to small datasets. <br> 
** However, its effectiveness diminishes significantly with larger datasets, where it struggles to deliver optimal results. Conversely, the greedy algorithm excels in handling larger datasets, outperforming both the local search and genetic algorithms in these scenarios.<br>
** This insight highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate algorithm based on dataset size and characteristics to achieve optimal performance.
